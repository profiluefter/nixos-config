# My NixOS configuration

## TODO

* Fix Telegram autostart
* Configure [Peerix](https://github.com/cid-chan/peerix)
* General refactoring
  * find solution for better device specific configuration
* Move global configuration to individual projects
  * e.g. make Android SDK only available in Android projects
* Pull certain Docker images as part of the system build, so they do not have to be persisted
